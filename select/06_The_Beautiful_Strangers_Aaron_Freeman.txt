All the beautiful strangers
Who help me through the nights
And fell down into darkness
On pillow soft and white

All the beautiful strangers
All in the afternoon
Who prays my flat little stomach
And came back to my own

All the beautiful strangers
Who help me through the nights
And fell down into darkness
On pillow soft and white

They taught me neon's just as nice
'Cause afternoon sun shines
