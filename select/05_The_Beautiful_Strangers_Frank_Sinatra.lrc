[00:21.38] All the beautiful strangers
[00:28.35] Who held me for a night
[00:35.53] And fell down in the darkness
[00:43.37] On pillows soft and white
[00:55.87] 
[00:51.07] All the beautiful strangers
[00:59.05] All in the afternoon
[01:05.56] Who praised my flat little stomache
[01:13.46] And came back to my room
[01:25.46] 
[01:43.75] All the beautiful strangers
[01:51.26] They spoiled me for a time
[01:59.02] And they taught me
[02:01.69] Neon's just as nice as afternoon sunshine
