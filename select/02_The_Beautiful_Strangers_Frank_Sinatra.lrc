[00:21.31] All the beautiful strangers
[00:28.37] Who held me for a night
[00:35.52] And fell down in the darkness
[00:43.32] On pillows soft and white
[00:55.82] 
[00:51.04] All the beautiful strangers
[00:59.06] All in the afternoon
[01:05.57] Who praised my flat little stomache
[01:13.40] And came back to my room
[01:25.40] 
[01:43.78] All the beautiful strangers
[01:51.22] They spoiled me for a time
[01:59.02] And they taught me
[02:01.69] Neon's just as nice as afternoon sunshine
